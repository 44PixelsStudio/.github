# 44 Pixels Studio
44 Pixels Studio is an independent studio founded by @[heidihelen](https://github.com/heidihelen) in Adelaide, South Australia, that works remotely with a small team of developers in the United States.

We work on [When Did Iâ€¦?](http://whendidi.app/), an iOS app for tracking when you did things, such as changing the sheets or taking a multivitamin.

Heidi has also collaborated with [Illuminated Bits](http://www.illuminatedbits.com) through 44 Pixels, to work on apps including Capsicum, a planner for iPhone and iPad, and Boomerang, a language-translation app.
